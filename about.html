        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Backyard Burgers is a burger joint that was started in Lexington, KY in 2002. We are known for serving delicious burgers fresh off the grill.  Over the past 15 years we have grown and now have 21 locations in 6 different states. Our burgers are crafted with the highest quality beef and grilled to perfection over an open flame. Our bread is made for us by local bakers and delivered fresh daily. We owe a huge thanks to our local communities for joining us on our journey, and we hope that you'll continue to be a part of our story.</p>
